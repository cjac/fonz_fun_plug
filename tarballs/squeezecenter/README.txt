SQUEEZECENTER FUN-PLUG


IMPORTANT: If you want to upgrade the squeezecenter-funplug to a newer
	   version, it is strongly recommended that you completely
	   uninstall the old funplug, first!


Download fun_plug and fun_plug.tgz to Volume_1, then reboot the NAS
device using the Web interface (Tools -> System -> Restart).


NOTE: Do not use the web-based download tool!


After reboot, the fun-plug will automatically install the
Squeezecenter package.


A few minutes later, the Squezecenter Web interface becomes available
at
  http://dns323:9000/ 
(replace dns323 with the name or IP address of your NAS device).

A small administration interface is available at
  http://dns323:90/
