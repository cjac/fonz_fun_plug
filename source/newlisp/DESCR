newLISP is a LISP-like scripting language for doing things you
typically do with scripting languages: programming for the internet,
system administration, text processing, gluing other programs
together, etc. newLISP is a scripting LISP for people who are
fascinated by LISP's beauty and power of expression, but who need it
stripped down to easy-to-learn essentials. newLISP is small on
resources like disk space and memory but has a deep, practical API.
