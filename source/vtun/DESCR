What is VTun ?
VTun is the easiest way to create Virtual Tunnels over TCP/IP networks
with traffic shaping, compression, and encryption. At least, we think
so.  It supports IP, PPP, SLIP, Ethernet and other tunnel types.  VTun
is easily and highly configurable, it can be used for various network
tasks.
