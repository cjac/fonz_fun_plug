ffp-base is a collection of libraries and programs gathered from other ffp 
packages. The package is intended to give a fairly complete initial set to 
which additional packages can be added as needed.

ffp-base also includes the complete set of busybox links. Note that upgrading 
this package will restore these links unconditionally and overwrite programs 
from the coreutils package (if installed).

ffp-base contains libraries and programs from
  uclibc, e2fsprogs, file, libiconv, ncurses, sqlite
and libraries from
  expat, gcc, libusb, libxml2, openssl, pcre, readline, tcp_wrappers, zlib
