GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images by 
programmers. GD creates PNG, JPEG and GIF images, among other formats. GD is 
commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails, and most anything else, 
on the fly. While not restricted to use on the web, the most common 
applications of GD involve web site development.

The library was originally developped by Thomas Boutell and is now maintained 
by Pierre-A. Joye under the umbrella of PHP.net.
