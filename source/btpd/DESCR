Btpd is a utility for sharing files over the BitTorrent network
protocol. It runs in daemon mode, thus needing no controlling terminal
or gui. Instead, the daemon is controlled by the btcli command line
utility, or other programs capable of sending commands and queries on
the btpd control socket.

The goal is to provide a healthy alternative to the still prevailing
ftp/http servers for file distribution sites and a good BitTorrent
client for the casual user.
